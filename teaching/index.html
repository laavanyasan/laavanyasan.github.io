<div class="Teaching">

	<p>As an educator, I aim to use biology and genetics as a way for student to explore their ideas about the natural
		world and understanding the interconnected nature of life. I also emphasize using real-world examples and historical contexts as themes with which
		students can engage with the themes and reflect on the current narratives of science and biology.</p>

	<p> Throughout graduate school, teaching has been one of my focal points through academic coursework, my peadagogical training certificate of college teaching, my work as a Teaching on Purpose Fellow and educational outreach activities </p>
		
	<p class="lead">Academic Coursework</p>
	<p>I have had the opportunity to work on various teaching teams</p>
	<p class="text-success bg-warning">Epigenetics</p>
	<p>Fall 2022 UPGEN 778</p>
	<ul>Redeisgned a course taken by 1st and 2nd year PhD students to update historical context, current technological and translational perspectives, and implement active learning activities.</ul>
	<p class="text-success bg-warning">Gateway to Biology: Molecular Biology</p>
	<p>Spring 2021 Laboratory BIO201</p>
	<ul>Designed and instructed the laboratory sections as the only lab instructor for each of my sections (~20 undergraduate students) by implementing a project that will be developed over the coourse of the semester. This inlcudes basic biology laboratory skills, as well as introductory exploratory bioinformatics skills. </ul>
	<p>Spring 2021 BIOL201</p>
	<ul>Support and TA for a large (~200 1st - 3rd year undergraudate students) on introductory molecular biology. Developed learning resources, held student hours, and pre-exam practice sessions.I taught one of the laboratory sections in addition to the support TA role for the class</ul>
	
	<p class="text-success text-bold strong">Genome Wide Association Studies from Population Genetics Perspective</p>
	<p>Fall 2021 BIOL318</p>
	<ul>Designed and implemented a module on "Genome Wide Association Studies â€“ design, results & biases" as a series of guest lectures for a small upperlevel undergraduate class (~15 students, 3rd year and above undergraduates). Some activities included discussion on population genetics, ancestry, race and biases in GWAS, regression analyses and simple genetic association testing using python notebooks </ul>
	<p class="text-success text-bold strong">Personal Genetics in the context of Public Health</p>
	<p>Spring 2022 PBH101</p>
	<ul>Designed and implemented a module on "Genetics and genomics in the context of public health " as a series of guest lectures for a core public health undergraduate class at Guilford College with Dr. Aleks Babic (~30 students, 1st and 2nd year undergraduates). Some activities included introductory atatistical analyses, critical discussion of primary and secondary literature, the role of community in genetuics research, perspectives on NIH-based personal genomics initiatives as well as direct-to-consumer personal genomics intitiatives to discuss data safety, use and protection. </ul>

	<p class="lead">Pedagogical Training</p>
	<p class="text-success text-bold">Certificate in College Teaching</p>
	<p>I completed the requirements for the Certificate in College Teaching Program (2022) with course work in:
	<ul>
		<li>Fundamentals in College Teaching (GS750) </li>
		<li>College Teaching & Course Design (GS755)</li>
		<li>College Teaching, Diverse Learners, and Contentious Issues (GS767)</li>
		<li>Duke Summer Academy - Best Practices in Mentoring (GS 990)</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p class="text-success text-bold">Teaching on Purpose Fellowship</p>
	<p>I was also selected as a fellow among the inaugural cohort of <a
			href="https://kenan.ethics.duke.edu/teaching-on-purpose-program-preps-graduate-students-to-explore-questions-of-meaning-in-the-classroom/">Teaching
			on Purpose Fellows</a> through the <a href="https://kenan.ethics.duke.edu/">Kenan Institute for Ethics</a>.
		This program brings together a cross-disciplinary group of faculty and graduate students across disciplines to
		reflect on what being good teacher of undergraduates is, and teaching within the university system at different
		levels.</p>

	<p class="text-success text-bold">Courses I can teach:</p>
	<ul>These are general coursework topics, and will include appropriate labs.
		<li>Molecular biology (Introductory + advanced) </li>
		<li>Intro to genetics (Introductor + advanced)</li>
		<li>Introduction to computationsal and statistical biology (R environment)</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
