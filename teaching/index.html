<div class="Teaching">

	<p>As an educator, I aim to use biology and genetics as a way for student to explore their ideas about the natural
		world and understanding the interconnected nature of life. </p>

	<p>When teaching introductory molecular biology, I draw upon my knowledge of medical genetics and genomics fields to
		help students build their foundational knowledge using different perspectives spanning medical, evolutionary and
		population biology. I also emphasize using real-world examples and historical contexts as themes with which
		students can engage with the themes and reflect on the current narratives of science and biology. </p>

	<p class="lead">Teaching Experience</p>
	<p class="text-success bg-warning">Co-instructional role</p>
	<ul>In Fall 2022, I co-instructed a graduate module on "Epigenetics" with Dr. Greg Crawford at Duke University. In
		designing this module, I combined chalk-talk and presentation style lecture along with critical reading of
		scientific literature skills for first- and second-year graduate students. This approach allowed the students to
		both understand new scientific concepts, and using that to better analyze seminal papers in the field for class
		discussion. Feedback from the professor and the students highlighted my approachability, my willingness to look
		up answers as well as provide feedback for the student presentations.</ul>
	<p class="text-success bg-warning">Teaching Assistantships</p>
	<ul>In Spring 2021, I taught a sections (~20 students) of Molecular Biology (Bio202L), an introductory laboratory
		course. In this class, students explore an overview of molecular biology concepts such as biomolecules,
		metabolism, and genetics concepts. I have led the lab section of the class where the students learned
		foundational lab skills with an overaching project for the semester. In lab classes, I have facilitated broad
		enagagement combing small-group discussion, chalk-talk style lectures, presentations with visual aids as well as
		written evaluations. I strongly believe in framing an understanding of science within the context of the current
		world we are in. For example, as students performed DNA isolation and PCR techniques in the lab, as a group we
		discusssed its applications in COVID testing and symptom monitoring that all students had to complete every
		other day. Student feedback on my laboratory teaching reflects my strengths including : i)contextualizing
		infromation, ii) approachability and iii)encouraging and engagement. I also solicit feedback outside of the
		university system and adjust topics/preferences as each week progresses based on student engagement and
		learning. </ul>
	<ul>During this semester, with COVID precautions, we also faced with a sudden transition into online labs. Some of
		the picots in the learning plan focused on exploratory bioinformatics questions for the students to work on
		based on the latest results in their lab projects thus far. During this teaching experience, I received peer
		feedback that highlighted my adaptability in this situation, while maintaining an engaging virtual atmosphere
	</ul>
	<p class="text-success text-bold strong">Guest Lectures</p>
	<ul> I worked with Dr. Aleks Babic at Guilford College to develop a two-part guest lecture series for their course
		"Intro to Public Health". In designing this module, I focused on "Personal genomics as a public health concept",
		where the students read primary and secondary literature understanding how genetics and genomics has/ and can
		influence publich health policies, genetics and genomics in agriculture for subsistence, the role of community
		in genetics research. I also devised workshops for the students to critically identify advantages of several
		personal genomics intitiatives as well as NIH-based initiatives, while also discussing their thoughts of data
		safety, use and protection. </ul>
	<ul> I have designed a two-part guest lecture series for upperclass undergraduate students on "Genome Wide
		Association Studies â€“ design, results & biases" for Dr. Iman Hamid's class on "Population Genetics" at Duke
		University. In designing this module, I focused on building a foundational understanding of statistical analyses
		for GWAS. I also set up a workshop for the students to explore and discuss the current biases in GWAS data from
		a population genetics perspectives. The students also performed regression analyses and simple genetic
		association testing to explore the statistical concepts using python notebooks. </ul>

	<p class="lead">Pedagogical Training</p>
	<p class="text-success text-bold">Certificate in College Teaching</p>
	<p>I completed the requirements for the Certificate in College Teaching Program (2022) with course work in:
	<ul>
		<li>Fundamentals in College Teaching (GS750) </li>
		<li>College Teaching & Course Design (GS755)</li>
		<li>College Teaching, Diverse Learners, and Contentious Issues (GS767)</li>
		<li>Duke Summer Academy - Best Practices in Mentoring (GS 990)</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p class="text-success text-bold">Teaching on Purpose Fellowship</p>
	<p>I was also selected as a fellow among the inaugural cohort of <a
			href="https://kenan.ethics.duke.edu/teaching-on-purpose-program-preps-graduate-students-to-explore-questions-of-meaning-in-the-classroom/">Teaching
			on Purpose Fellows</a> through the <a href="https://kenan.ethics.duke.edu/">Kenan Institute for Ethics</a>.
		This program brings together a cross-disciplinary group of faculty and graduate students across disciplines to
		reflect on what being good teacher of undergraduates is, and teaching within the university system at different
		levels.</p>

	<p class="text-success text-bold">Courses I can teach:</p>
	<ul>These are general coursework topics, and will include appropriate labs.
		<li>Molecular biology (Introductory + advanced) </li>
		<li>Intro to genetics (Introductor + advanced)</li>
		<li>Introduction to computationsal and statistical biology (R environment)</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
