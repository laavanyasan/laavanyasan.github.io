<div class="Research projects">

	<p> I am interested in the complexities of gene regulation and genomic architecture, and its relevance for human diseases. This page is a work in progress </p>

<p> For my PhD at Duke, I am working on projects that seek to use genomic technologies to answer questions related to gene regulation and genetic variants involved in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.
   I am advised by Dr. Tim Reddy, and I collaborate with Dr. Andrea Dunaif at Mt. Sinai.   </p>
