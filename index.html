	<p class="lead">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Laavanya</span> (she/her) and I am currently a PhD candiate in Genetics and Genomics</p>
	<p>Welcome to my website and thank you for visiting!

I am a geneticist, broadly interested in mechanisms of gene regulation, genetic variants in populations, and biology education. 

Currently, I am a PhD candidate in Duke University in the Genetics and Genomics Program. For my thesis, I am investigating at the role of regulatory regions and non-coding variants in the context of the reproductive disorder - polycystic ovary syndrome with Dr. Tim Reddy in the Duke  Center for Advanced Genomic Technologies. 
		Some of my current work focuses on developing and optimising genomic technologies to assay roles of genomic regions in regulating gene expression levels using models of ovarian tissue and designing approaches to assay allele-specific expressions in patient/control sample populations.
		
		I am also passionate about education and teaching and I have been selected as a 2021-2022 Preparing Future Faculty Fellow and 2022 Teaching on Purpose Fellow.</p>
