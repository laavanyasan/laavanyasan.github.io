<div class="About Me">

	<p> I found my interest in science as I explored the the how's and why's of the world around us, and over time I realized that I loved teaching and mentoring people in science.  </p>
	<p>I studied Biotechnology Engineering and Molecular Biology at Anna University and University of Pennsylvania to merge my interest in the biological world and solving puzzles.</p>
