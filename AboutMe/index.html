	<p class="text-success bg-warning">Teaching Dogs & Dog agility</p>
	
	<ul> Among my hobbies, my dog and I are invested in competitive agility, and we are working towards our first Master Agility Champion title. </ul>
	<ul> My teaching philosophy in identifying motivators and setting p[eople up for succcess also spills into the canine world. I love working with puppies and young dogs to train them for basic good citizenship behaviours, and also build foundational skills for dog agility as a team sport and bonding experience. </ul>
