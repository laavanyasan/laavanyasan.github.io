By combining the ability to manipulate gene expression with the capacity to measure RNA transcripts at single-cell resolution using flow-cytometry, we can investigate the functional consequences of gene regulation within complex biological systems and disease states. In this study, I describe establishing and scaling up HCR in two cell lines as a potential method for further functional analysis in GWAS loci. As a proof of concept, we performed the first set of studies to measuring the glucocorticoid (GC) response in a cell model used to study the glucocorticoid receptor.  We then tested HCR using H295R cells to build a cell model system for future perturbation studies across PCOS GWAS loci to identify target genes of PCOS-associated regulatory elements. We were able to use HCR to measure changes in gene expression as a response to several different kinds of perturbations. These results highlight the scalable and generalizable potential of HCR across different types of experiments.
