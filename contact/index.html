<div class="Teaching">

	<p>As an educator, I aim to use biology and genetics as a way for student to explore their ideas about the natural world and understanding the interconnected nature of life. </p>

<p>When teaching introductory molecular biology, I draw upon my knowledge of medical genetics and genomics fields to help students build their foundational knowledge using different perspectives spanning medical, evolutionary and population biology. I also emphasize using real-world examples and historical contexts as themes with which students can engage with the themes and reflect on the current narratives of science and biology. </p>
