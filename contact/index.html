<div class="Teaching">

	<p>As an educator, I aim to use biology and genetics as a way for student to explore their ideas about the natural world and understanding the interconnected nature of life. </p>

<p>When teaching introductory molecular biology, I draw upon my knowledge of medical genetics and genomics fields to help students build their foundational knowledge using different perspectives spanning medical, evolutionary and population biology. I also emphasize using real-world examples and historical contexts as themes with which students can engage with the themes and reflect on the current narratives of science and biology. </p>

	<p class="text-success text-bold">Teaching Assistantships</p>
	<ul>In Spring 2021, I taught a sections (~20 students) of Molecular Biology (Bio202L), an introductory laboratory course. In this class, students explore an overview of molecular biology concepts such as biomolecules, metabolism, and genetics concepts. I have led the lab section of the class where the students learned foundational lab skills with an overaching project for the semester. In lab classes, I have facilitated broad enagagement combing small-group discussion, chalk-talk style lectures, presentations with visual aids as well as written evaluations. I strongly believe in framing an understanding of science within the context of the current world we are in. For example, as students performed DNA isolation and PCR techniques in the lab, as a group we discusssed its applications in COVID testing and symptom monitoring that all students had to complete every other day. Student feedback on my laboratory teaching reflects my strengths including : i)contextualizing infromation, ii) approachability and iii)encouraging and engagement. I also solicit feedback outside of the university system and adjust topics/preferences as each week progresses based on student engagement and learning. </ul>
	<ul>During this semester, with COVID precautions, we also faced with a sudden transition into online labs. Some of the picots in the learning plan focused on exploratory bioinformatics questions for the students to work on based on the latest results in their lab projects thus far. During this teaching experience, I received peer feedback that highlighted my adaptability in this situation, while maintaining an engaging virtual atmosphere  </ul>

	<p class="lead">Pedagogical Training</p>
	<p>I completed the requirements for the Certificate in College Teaching Program with course work in:
	<ul>
	<li>Fundamentals in College Teaching (GS750) </li>
	<li>College Teaching & Course Design (GS755)</li>
	<li>College Teaching, Diverse Learners, and Contentious Issues (GS767)</li>

<p class="text-success text-bold">Teaching on Purpose Fellowship</p>
<p>I was also selected as a fellow among the inaugural cohort of <a href="https://kenan.ethics.duke.edu/teaching-on-purpose-program-preps-graduate-students-to-explore-questions-of-meaning-in-the-classroom/">Teaching on Purpose Fellows</a> through the <a href="https://kenan.ethics.duke.edu/">Kenan Institute for Ethics</a>. This program  brings together a cross-disciplinary group of faculty and graduate students across disciplines to reflect on what being good teacher of undergraduates is, and teaching within the university system at different levels.</p>

	<p class="text-success text-bold">Courses I can teach:</p>
		<ul>These are general coursework topics, and will include appropriate labs.
	<li>Molecular biology (Introductory + advanced) </li>
	<li>Intro to genetics (Introductor + advanced)</li>
	<li>Introduction to computationsal and statistical biology (R environment)</li>
	</ul></p>
